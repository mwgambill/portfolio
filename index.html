          <h2>About Myself</h2>
          <p>I've always had a passion for technology and computers. Backgrounds of manufacturing, skilled tradework and some I.T. experience, make me versatile and excellent at problem solving.</p>
          <p>My interest in "how things work" really fueled me to get into coding and web devolpment. Through high school and the years after, I dabbled in graphic + website design. Learning the basics of HTML, CSS and even a bit of JavaScript.</p>
          <p>After being a CNC Machinist for about 5 years, I've decided to put my skills to use and make a career change. Now, as a student at <a href="http://www.thinkful.com"><b>Thinkful</b></a>, I am excited to make this transition; to learn and grow with you all! </p>
